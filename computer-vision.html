            <h1>How Computers "See"</h1>
            <p>
                How do you know a cat is a cat and a dog is a dog? You have eyes and a brain that's learned to tell the difference. Computer Vision is how we teach computers to do the same thing! We show the computer thousands of pictures of cats and dogs, and it learns to spot the differences.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is used in all sorts of cool things, like self-driving cars that can "see" the road and other cars, or apps that can find your face in a photo.

                    This activity from AI Unplugged helps us think about how computers can recognize emotions.
                </p>
                <h4>You will need:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paper and markers or crayons</li>
                    <li>Scissors</li>
                    <li>Glue or tape</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to Play:</h4>
                <p>Let's create a robot face that can show different emotions, just like a computer would!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Draw and cut out a big circle for the face.</li>
                    <li>Draw and cut out different kinds of eyes, mouths, and eyebrows. Make happy eyes, sad eyes, surprised eyes. Make a happy mouth, a sad mouth, and a surprised mouth.</li>
                    <li>Now, let's create rules to show emotions! For example:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Happy:</strong> Smiling mouth + wide eyes</li>
                        <li><strong>Sad:</strong> Frowning mouth + droopy eyes</li>
                        <li><strong>Surprised:</strong> Open mouth + wide eyes with raised eyebrows</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Mix and match your face parts to create your own emotions!</li>
                </ol>
