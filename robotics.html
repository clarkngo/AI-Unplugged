            <h1>AI and Robots</h1>
            <p>
                What do you think of when you hear the word "robot"? You might think of a walking, talking machine from a movie. But robots are all around us, and many of them are powered by AI!
            </p>

            <h2>What's it all about?</h2>
            <p>Robotics is the science of designing, building, and programming robots. A robot is a machine that can be programmed to do a series of actions. But a robot with AI is much more than just a machine. It can learn, make decisions, and interact with the world in amazing ways.</p>
            <p>AI gives robots their "brains". It allows them to see with cameras (computer vision), understand our commands (natural language processing), and learn from their experiences (machine learning). Without AI, a robot is just a puppet. With AI, a robot can become a partner.</p>

            <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> Robots are used in factories to build cars, computers, and other products. They can do repetitive tasks quickly and accurately.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Robots can be used to help doctors perform surgery with more precision. They can also help people who have lost a limb to move again.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> We send robots to explore places that are too dangerous for humans, like other planets, deep oceans, and even active volcanoes!</li>
                <li><strong>At Home:</strong> You might have a robot vacuum cleaner at home that uses AI to navigate around your furniture and clean your floors.</li>
            </ul>

                    Let's design a robot to solve a problem! What kind of robot would you build?

                <h4>Your Mission:</h4>
                <p>Design a robot that can help you with a chore you don't like to do. For example, a robot that cleans your room, does your homework, or walks the dog.</p>
                <h4>Think about:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is your robot's name?</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>What does it look like?</strong> Draw a picture of your robot.</li>
                    <li><strong>What is its job?</strong> What chore does it do?</li>
                    <li><strong>What sensors does it need?</strong> Does it need eyes (cameras)? Ears (microphones)? Hands (grippers)?</li>
                    <li><strong>What instructions would you give it?</strong> How would you program it to do its job?</li>
                </ul>
