            <h1>How Computers "Talk"</h1>
            <p>
                Isn't it cool when you can talk to a computer and it understands you? That's called Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short. It's all about teaching computers to understand and use human languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about when you ask a smart speaker to tell you a joke, or when your phone corrects your spelling in a text message. That's NLP at work! It's a very important part of AI that helps us communicate with our devices.

                <h3>🧠 The Brain-in-a-Bag 🛍️</h3>
                <p>
                    This AI Unplugged activity is a fun way to see how a neural network can be "programmed" to learn.
                </p>
                <h4>You will need:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bag</li>
                    <li>Many small items of two different colors (e.g., red and black beads)</li>
                    <li>A friend to play with</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to Play:</h4>
                <p>This game simulates a simple neural network. The bag is the "brain", and the beads are like "neurons".</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with an equal number of red and black beads in the bag.</li>
                    <li>Your friend will secretly pick a color (red or black).</li>
                    <li>You will try to guess the color your friend picked.</li>
                    <li>Reach into the bag and pull out a bead. The color of the bead is your guess.</li>
                    <li>If you guessed correctly, your friend says "Yes!". To reward the "brain", you put the bead back in the bag and add another bead of the same color.</li>
                    <li>If you guessed incorrectly, your friend says "No!". To "punish" the brain, you take the bead out of the bag.</li>
                    <li>Play again! Over time, the bag will have more of the color that your friend picked, and you will be more likely to guess correctly. The "brain" has learned!</li>
                </ol>
