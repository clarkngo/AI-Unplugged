            <h1>What in the World is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
            <p>
                Imagine if your toys could think and learn, just like you! That's kind of what Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is all about. It's like giving a computer a "brain" so it can solve problems, play games, and even be creative!
            </p>

            <h2>What's it all about?</h2>
            <p>AI is a big topic, but at its heart, it's about making computers smart. We can do this in a few ways. Sometimes, we give the computer a set of rules to follow, like in the "Intelligent Paper" game. This is called **symbolic AI** or **rule-based AI**. The computer isn't really "thinking" for itself, but it can seem very smart by following the rules perfectly.</p>
            <p>Other times, we want the computer to learn on its own, like we do. This is called **machine learning**. We show the computer lots of examples of something, and it learns to recognize patterns. For example, if you show a computer thousands of pictures of cats, it will eventually learn to recognize a cat on its own!</p>

            <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Assistants:</strong> When you talk to a smart speaker like Alexa or Siri, you're using AI. They use AI to understand your voice and answer your questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Games:</strong> The characters in your video games that play against you are often controlled by AI. They are programmed to be challenging and fun to play against.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Driving Cars:</strong> These cars use AI to "see" the world around them and make decisions about how to drive safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Movie Recommendations:</strong> When Netflix or Disney+ suggests a movie you might like, that's AI at work! It learns what you like to watch and suggests similar movies.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>ü§ñ Let's Play "Intelligent Paper"! üìù</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a super fun game from AI Unplugged that shows how something as simple as a piece of paper can seem "intelligent" if it has the right instructions.
                </p>
                <h4>You will need:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A piece of paper</li>
                    <li>A pencil or pen</li>
                    <li>A friend to play with</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to Play:</h4>
                <p>This game is like Tic-Tac-Toe, but the paper has a secret... it can't lose! You will be the "computer" and your friend will be the "player".</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Draw a Tic-Tac-Toe board on your paper.</li>
                    <li>The player goes first, putting an X in any square.</li>
                    <li>Now it's your turn to be the computer! Follow these rules to decide where to put your O:</li>
                </ol>
