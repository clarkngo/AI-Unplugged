            <h1>What in the World is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
            <p>
                Imagine if your toys could think and learn, just like you! That's kind of what Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is all about. It's like giving a computer a "brain" so it can solve problems, play games, and even be creative!
            </p>
            <p>
                AI is not about robots taking over the world like in the movies. It's about teaching computers to be helpful assistants. Think about a smart speaker that plays your favorite song when you ask, or a game that knows how to play against you. That's AI in action!

                <h3>🤖 Let's Play "Intelligent Paper"! 📝</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a super fun game from AI Unplugged that shows how something as simple as a piece of paper can seem "intelligent" if it has the right instructions.
                </p>
                <h4>You will need:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A piece of paper</li>
                    <li>A pencil or pen</li>
                    <li>A friend to play with</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How to Play:</h4>
                <p>This game is like Tic-Tac-Toe, but the paper has a secret... it can't lose! You will be the "computer" and your friend will be the "player".</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Draw a Tic-Tac-Toe board on your paper.</li>
                    <li>The player goes first, putting an X in any square.</li>
                    <li>Now it's your turn to be the computer! Follow these rules to decide where to put your O:</li>
                </ol>
