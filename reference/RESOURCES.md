# Resources — curated links for lesson ideas and background

This document gathers external resources that can help expand AI Unplugged lesson ideas, printable packs, and teacher guidance. Each link includes a short note about what it provides and how you might use it when building or adapting lessons for different grade bands.

- https://dayofai.org/curriculum/  
	What it is: The Day of AI curriculum contains short, multimedia lesson modules and teacher-facing materials designed to introduce AI concepts to school students.  
	How to use it: Adapt ready-made modules for classroom use, extract slide decks and student-facing activities, and borrow assessment prompts or discussion questions for printable packs.

- https://story-ai.co/index.html#/  
	What it is: An interactive storytelling and prompt-driven tool for exploring generative AI and narrative creation. (Useful as a demo or scaffold for creative activities.)  
	How to use it: Use it to create example prompts, generate classroom-safe outputs for critique, or run controlled generative exercises in blended lessons (teacher-supervised).

- https://pa-gov.libguides.com/c.php?g=1377901&p=10377899  
	What it is: A curated libguide page (library guide) collecting educational resources about AI and related teaching materials.  
	How to use it: Harvest curated links, bibliographies and local education resources; use as a pointer for further reading and for sourcing classroom-friendly references.

- https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21582440251336708  
	What it is: A peer‑reviewed article in an education research journal. The article can provide evidence-based findings and design recommendations for teaching AI/CS topics.  
	How to use it: Read for background research when designing curriculum sequences or when writing teacher guidance that cites educational studies and learning outcomes.

- https://www.csunplugged.org/en/topics/  
	What it is: CS Unplugged's comprehensive topic index and activity collection for teaching computing concepts without computers. Includes lesson notes, curriculum mapping and class tips.  
	How to use it: Map AI Unplugged activities to CS Unplugged topics, reuse proven unplugged activities as inspiration, and adapt classroom management and pacing strategies.

Suggested next steps

- Pull example lesson fragments from Day of AI and CS Unplugged to create printable worksheets for each K‑band.  
- Use Story-AI to generate safe example outputs that accompany generative-activity lesson plans.  
- Reference the SAGE article when drafting evidence-informed teacher notes and assessment guidance.

If you'd like, I can convert selected pages or assets from these resources into ready-to-print teacher packs and add them to `public/printables/` with attribution notes.
