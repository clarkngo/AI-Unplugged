            <h1>Why Teach AI Without a Computer?</h1>
            <p>AI Unplugged activities are designed to teach the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence without using computers. This approach has several benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessible to Everyone:</strong> No need for expensive hardware or high-speed internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Concepts:</strong> By removing the technical jargon and code, learners can focus on the fundamental ideas behind AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Engaging and Fun:</strong> Activities are hands-on, collaborative, and often feel like playing a game.</li>
                <li><strong>Develops Computational Thinking:</strong> These activities build skills like problem-solving, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Getting Started: Core Principles</h3>
                <p>The best way to start is by exploring the fundamental questions. What does it mean for a machine to be "intelligent"? How can we give instructions to a computer? Our "What is AI?" lesson is a great starting point.</p>

            <h2>Unplugged Activity Examples</h2>
            <p>Many AI topics can be explored through simple and fun activities that you can do right in a classroom or at home. Here are a few ideas based on the lessons on this site:</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning: The "Intelligent Piece of Paper"</h3>
            <p>This classic activity demonstrates how a machine can "learn" to play a game. Students play a simple game like Hexapawn against a "machine" made of matchboxes or paper. The machine learns from its mistakes and eventually becomes an unbeatable player. This teaches the core concept of reinforcement learning.</p>

            <h3>Computer Vision: "I Spy" with a Twist</h3>
            <p>How does a computer "see"? Play a game of "I Spy" where one person (the "computer") can only ask yes/no questions about simple features like shapes, colors, and textures. This simulates how a computer vision model breaks down an image into simple, recognizable patterns.</p>

            <h3>Generative AI: Story Dice</h3>
            <p>Generative AI creates new things. A simple way to understand this is with story dice. Each die has a different picture on it. Roll the dice and create a story based on the pictures that come up. This mimics how a generative model uses a set of rules and data to generate new, creative outputs.</p>

            <p>By using imagination and simple materials, you can unlock the complex world of AI for learners of all ages!</p>
