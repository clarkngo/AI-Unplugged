    <h1>ðŸ¤– AI Unplugged</h1>
    <p>
        "CS Unplugged" is a fantastic collection of free activities that teach computer science concepts without a computer. Here's how you can create your own "AI Unplugged" experience, focusing on their "Artificial Intelligence" activities. The main idea is to explore AI concepts through engaging games and puzzles that use simple materials like cards, paper, and pens.

    <h2>Core Activities</h2>

    <div class="activity">
        <h3>1. The Intelligent Piece of Paper</h3>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> This activity demonstrates how a simple set of rules can make a piece of paper appear "intelligent." It's a great introduction to algorithms and how computers can be programmed to play games perfectly.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Students play tic-tac-toe against a piece of paper that has a complete set of rules for playing a perfect game. The paper, despite not "thinking," will never lose.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="activity">
        <h3>2. The Brain-in-a-Bag</h3>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> This activity simulates how neurons in the brain work and how a neural network can be "programmed" to learn.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The class creates an artificial "brain" using simple materials and "programs" it to play a game like Red-black snap. This provides a tangible way to understand the basics of machine learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="activity">
        <h3>3. The Emotional Robot & Create-a-Face</h3>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> These activities explore "affective computing," which is how computers can recognize and express emotions.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> A short video shows a robot reacting to a speaker's voice. The class then builds a robot face and programs it with rules to show different emotions (happy, sad, surprised) in response to different sounds.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="activity">
        <h3>4. The Sweet Learning Computer</h3>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> This is a fun and interactive way to demonstrate machine learning through reinforcement.</p>
        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The class plays a game of Hexapawn against a "machine" made of sweets. When the machine loses, some of its "rules" (the sweets) are "punished" by being eaten. Over time, the machine learns from its mistakes and becomes a better player.</p>

    <h2>How to Get Started âœ…</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Explore the "Artificial Intelligence" section</strong> of the classic CS Unplugged website: <a href="https://classic.csunplugged.org/activities/community-activities/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">AI Activities Home</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Download the free materials:</strong> The website provides PDF instructions for the activities and links to related videos.</li>
        <li><strong>Gather your supplies:</strong> Most activities only require common classroom materials like paper, pens, cards, and sometimes sweets!</li>
        <li><strong>Have fun!</strong> These activities are designed to be engaging and interactive, making complex computer science concepts accessible and enjoyable.</li>
